- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version for:
   - CYW920829M2EVK-02: v1.0.2
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: [AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; LE SoC](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/airoc20829)



## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.16 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.30.1 (`IAR`)



## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; LE Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CYW920829M2EVK-02)(`CYW920829M2EVK-02`) – Default value of `TARGET`




## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; kit (CYW920829M2EVK-02) ships with KitProg3 version 2.21 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3 with latest version 2.40. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the Firmware Loader GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup
Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[LE PAwR Server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-pawr-server)" application with the desired name "MyPAwRServer" configured for the *CYW920829M2EVK-02* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW920829M2EVK-02 --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-pawr-server --user-app-name "MyPAwRServer" --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the CYW20829 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyPAwRServer" --add-bsp-name CYW920829M2EVK-02 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyPAwRServer" --set-active-bsp APP_CYW920829M2EVK-02
   ```

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application tool and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings:

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receiving data: Line Feed (LF) or auto setting

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CYW920829M2EVK-02 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, PAwR Client and multiple PAwR Server the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for PAwR Central and Peripheral sync established. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window: the PAwR Client and Server will exchange data.

5. Configure the PAwR parameters 

   *In the PAwR Client:* 

   Parameter | Description
   ----------|------------
   `PAWR_EVT_PERIOD` | Event period
   `PAWR_SUB_EVT_PERIOD` | Sub event period
   `PAWR_SUB_EVT_NUM` | Sub event number
   `PAWR_RESPONSE_DELAY` | Response delay
   `PAWR_RESPONSE_SPACE` | Response space

   *In the PAwR Server* 
   Parameter | Description
   ----------|------------
   `PAWR_PERIPHERAL_RSP_SLOT` | Response slot

The log from the PAwR Client show that the PAwR Client receives a response from the PAwR Server. The log from the PAwR Server show that the PAwR receives a response report from the PAwR Client.


## Steps to enable BTSpy logs

**Note:** This feature is available only for CYW920829M2EVK-02.

1. Navigate to the application Makefile and open it. Find the Makefile variable `ENABLE_SPY_TRACES` and set it to the value *1* as shown:

    ```
    ENABLE_SPY_TRACES = 1
    ```
2. Save the Makefile, and then build and program the application to the board.

3. Open the [ClientControl](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-host-apps-bt-ble/tree/master/client_control) application and make the following settings:
   - Set the baud rate to 3000000.
   - Deselect flow control.
   - Select the serial port and click on an open port.

4. Launch the [BTSpy](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-utils/tree/master/BTSpy) tool.

5. Press and release the reset button on the board to get the BTSpy logs on the BTSpy tool.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

The code example configures the device as a Bluetooth&reg; Periodic Advertisement with Response (PAwR) Server, which works with the PAwR Client. The PAwR Client starts extended advertising with the PAwR parameters and PAwR advertising. The PAwR Server starts scan when it finds the PAwR configuration in extended advertising, and then starts to sync with the PAwR Client using PAwR parameters. 

After the PAwR Server is synced with the PAwR Client, the PAwR Client can send data to the PAwR Server using PAwR indication event; the PAwR Server will respond with its data using the PAwR Response event. The PAwR Client and Server receive data in a sub event; the response slot can be seen in the UART log.

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and retargeting of standard I/O to the UART port are done using the retarget-io library.

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configurations as used in this code example. Note that all the configurations explained in this section have already been implemented in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide). This example uses the default configuration. See the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; Configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

**Note:** For CYW20829, if you want to use the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator tool, select the *AIROC&trade; BTSTACK with Bluetooth&reg; LE only (CYW20829, PSoC&trade; 6 with CYW43xxx Connectivity device)* option from the drop-down menu to select the device. Do not use the *PSoC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE Legacy Stack (PSoC&trade; 6-BLE)* option because it is not compatible with AIROC&trade; BTSTACK.
